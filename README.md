# Lazula

(See below for licensing info)

Hi! I'm Lazula, sometimes LazulaTenshi. I'm a collaborator on
[radare2](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2). I'm not an expert - I mostly
help manage code style and quality, as well as bugfixes.

I am not a developer by trade; I am a security professional. I'm far more
comfortable analyzing and breaking down existing code than creating it myself,
though I'm not out of my depth creating scripts to assist in or automate common
tasks. I'm most skilled in Python and C. I'm also learning some C++, and have
used Lua a little bit, mostly for modding Don't Starve.

I'm trying to branch out my experience by contributing to other projects.

## Certifications

* OSCP
* CompTIA Pentest+
* CCNA
* CCNA Security

## My Projects

* [MAPIS](https://github.com/Lazula/MAPIS): MAPIS (Multi-API Search) is a
  project I developed during my first internship at a SOC. It allows you to
  fetch data from multiple API endpoints, and caches all information in local
  JSON files with an optional disk quota.
* [optinit](https://github.com/Lazula/optinit): optinit is a tool I created due
  to issues I encountered with Kali's `livebuild` toolkit. It installs a
  collection of public repositories and custom scripts written by me.
* [cryptopals](https://github.com/Lazula/cryptopals): A collection of solutions
  for the challenges at [cryptopals.com](https://cryptopals.com) written in raw
  C89. The only library used is GMP for the large numbers required by asymmetric
  encryption.

## Contributions

* [radare2](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2) ([My PRs](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ALazula)):
