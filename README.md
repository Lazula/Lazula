# Lazula

(See below for licensing info)

Hi! I'm Lazula, sometimes LazulaTenshi. I'm a collaborator on
[radare2](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2). I'm not an expert - I mostly
help manage code style and quality, as well as bugfixes.

I am not a developer by trade; I am a security professional. I'm far more
comfortable analyzing and breaking down existing code than creating it myself,
though I'm not out of my depth creating scripts to assist in or automate common
tasks. I'm most skilled in Python and C. I'm also learning some C++, and have
used and read Lua while digging into and modding games like Don't Starve and
Project Zomboid.

## Certifications

* OSCP
* CompTIA Pentest+
* CCNA
* CCNA Security

## My Projects

* [MAPIS](https://github.com/Lazula/MAPIS): MAPIS (Multi-API Search) is a
  project I developed during my first internship at a SOC. It allows you to
  fetch data from multiple API endpoints, and caches all information in local
  JSON files with an optional disk quota.
* [optinit](https://github.com/Lazula/optinit): optinit is a tool I created due
  to issues with Kali's `livebuild` toolkit. It installs a collection of
  repositories and custom-written scripts.
* [cryptopals](https://github.com/Lazula/cryptopals): A collection of solutions
  for the challenges at [cryptopals.com](https://cryptopals.com) written in raw
  C89. The only library used is GMP for the large numbers required by
  asymmetric encryption.

## Contributions

* [radare2](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2): Code quality, refactoring,
  bugfixes.
* [Greater Flavor Mod](https://github.com/Historical-Expansion-Mod): A few
  bugfixes for decisions available when playing as Japan.
